This helper is designed to be a collection of new mechanics based on suggestions from the community, as well as a place to put any random ideas that we have.
If you have any ideas for new mechanics/entities that you want to see implemented, let us know, and if it sounds cool/doable we'll add it to the collection.
<br>
We have our own GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/CommunalHelper/CommunalHelper">CommunalHelper/CommunalHelper</a>.
<br>
You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.gg/celeste" target="_blank">Celeste Discord</a>, but we've also got our own <a href="https://discord.gg/rYM3tsUW3m">Communal Helper server</a>, so consider joining for bug reports, feature requests, and also just hanging out.
